    <h1>Router</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>1. Receives Data:</h2>
    <p></p>A device sends a request (like opening a website), which is broken into data packets.</p> 
    <h2>2. Identifies Destination:</h2>
    <p>The router receives these packets, reads the destination IP address from the packet's header, and identifies which network needs to receive the data.</p> 
    <h2>3. Checks Routing Table:</h2>
    <p>It consults its internal routing table, which contains rules and information about network paths.</p> 
    <h2>4. Determines Best Path:</h2>
    <p>Based on the routing table, the router calculates the most effective path for the packet to reach its destination.</p> 
    <h2>5. Forwards Packet:</h2>
    <p>The router forwards the packet to the next router or network segment on its journey.</p> 
    <h2>6. Repeats the Process:</h2>
    <p>This packet-by-packet forwarding process continues from router to router until the packet reaches its ultimate destination device.</p> 
    <h2>7. Returns Data:</h2>
    <p>Once the destination server responds with data, the process reverses, with the router sending the data to the correct device within your local network.</p>
