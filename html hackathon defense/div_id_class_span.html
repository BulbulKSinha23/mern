    <h2>DIV</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The &lt;div&gt; tag in HTML defines a division or a section within an HTML document. It is a fundamental and versatile block-level element primarily used for grouping and structuring content on a web page.</p> 
    <img src="div.png" alt="div">
    <h3>Key characteristics of the &lt;div&gt; tag:</h3>
    <b>Container for content: </b>
    <p>It acts as a generic container for other HTML elements, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and other &lt;div&gt; elements.</p>
    <b>No inherent visual styling: </b>
    <p>The &lt;div&gt; tag itself does not provide any specific visual formatting or styling. Its purpose is to group content, allowing for styling and layout control to be applied through CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).</p>
    <b>Block-level element: </b>
    <p>By default, a &lt;div&gt; element occupies the full available width and starts on a new line, creating a line break before and after it.</p>
    <h2>ID</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The id attribute in HTML provides a unique identifier for an HTML element within a document. This attribute is a global attribute, meaning it can be applied to any HTML element.</p> 
    <h3>Key characteristics and uses of the id attribute:</h3>
    <b>Uniqueness: </b>
    <p>The value of the id attribute must be unique within the entire HTML document. No two elements in the same document can share the same id.</p>
    <b>Styling with CSS: </b>
    <p>The id attribute is commonly used to apply specific styles to a single element using CSS. In CSS, an id selector is denoted by a hash symbol (#) followed by the id value.</p>

    <h2>CLASS</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>he HTML class attribute specifies one or more class names for an element. Classes are used by CSS and JavaScript to select and access specific elements. The class attribute can be used on any HTML element. The class name is case sensitive.</p>
    <h3>The class attribute serves the following key purposes:</h3>
    <b>CSS Styling:</b>
    <p>It allows developers to group multiple HTML elements together and apply the same CSS styles to all elements sharing a particular class name. This promotes reusability and simplifies styling.</p>
    <b>JavaScript Manipulation:</b> <p>JavaScript can easily select and manipulate HTML elements based on their class names. This is crucial for adding dynamic behavior and interactivity to web pages.</p>
    <b>Semantic Grouping (less common but possible):</b>
    <p>While IDs are typically used for unique identification, classes can also be used to semantically group related elements, even without immediate styling or scripting needs.</p>

    <h2>SPAN:</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The <b>&lt;span&gt;</b> tag in HTML is an inline-level element used to group and apply styling or scripting to a specific portion of text or other inline content within a larger block of text, such as a paragraph or heading.</p> 
    <h3>Key characteristics of the &lt;span&gt; tag:</h3>
    <b>Inline-level:</b>
    <p> Unlike block-level elements (like &lt;div&gt; or &lt;p&gt;), a &lt;span&gt; tag does not introduce a line break or start on a new line by default. It flows within the existing line of content.</p>
    <b>No inherent visual styling:</b>
    <p>By itself, a &lt;span&gt; tag does not apply any visual changes to the content it encloses. Its purpose is to act as a container for applying styles (via CSS) or manipulating content (via JavaScript).</p>
    <b>Semantic neutrality:</b> 
    <p>The &lt;span&gt; tag is a generic container and does not carry any specific semantic meaning, unlike tags like &lt;strong&gt; (for importance) or &lt;em&gt; (for emphasis). This makes it ideal for purely presentational or functional purposes.</p>
