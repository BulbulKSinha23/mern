    <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the foundational language for creating web pages and is a core component of web development. It provides the structure and content of a webpage through a system of elements and attributes.</p>
    <h2>Not a Programming Language:</h2>
    <p>HTML is a markup language, not a programming language. It describes the content and structure, but does not perform logical operations or control program flow.</p>
    <h2>Foundation for Styling and Interactivity:</h2>
    <p>While HTML provides the structure, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling and presentation, and JavaScript is used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. All three work together to create a complete web experience.</p>
    <h2>File Extension:</h2>
    <p>HTML files are typically saved with a .html or .htm extension, which tells web browsers how to interpret the content.</p>
    <h3>Data structure and Algorithm</h3>
    <p>Data structures are fundamental to organizing and storing data efficiently, while algorithms are methods for processing that data. Arrays, linked lists, and trees are three distinct and commonly used data structures.
    <ol>
        <li>Array</li>
        <li>Linked Lists</li>
        <li>Trees</li>
    </ol>
