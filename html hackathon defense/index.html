            <h2>How does Network Work?</h2>
            <p> a web browser sends an HTTP request to a web server, which responds by sending the website's data (HTML, CSS, etc.) back in packets across the network (primarily TCP/IP) to be reassembled and displayed by the browser. This process involves a series of steps including DNS lookups to find the server's IP address, routing packets to the correct destination, and reassembling the data at the client end to form the web page.</p>

            </ol>
            <h2>Port Number</h2>
            <p>A port number is a numerical identifier (like 0-65535) on a network device that directs incoming data to a specific application or service, similar to how an apartment number directs mail to a specific resident in a building. While an IP address identifies a device, a port number identifies a particular software application or service running on that device, ensuring the data goes to the correct program, such as web browsing (port 80) or secure web browsing (port 443).</p>

            <hr>
            <h2>WEB DEVELOPMENT</h2>
            <p>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three core technologies used to build web pages and web applications. They work together to define the structure, presentation, and behavior of content on the web.</p>
            <h2> HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</h2>
            <p><a href="ht.html" target="_blank">HTML</a> is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage using a system of elements and tags. These tags define various parts of the content, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more, creating the basic framework upon which other technologies build.</p> 
            <h3>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</h3>
            <p>CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation and visual formatting of a document written in HTML. It controls aspects like colors, fonts, layout, spacing, and how elements are displayed on different screen sizes. CSS separates the content (HTML) from its visual presentation, making it easier to manage and update the design of a website.</p>
            <h3>JavaScript (JS):</h3>
            <p>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It enables features like animations, form validation, real-time updates, and handling user interactions (e.g., button clicks, mouse movements). JavaScript can manipulate the HTML structure and CSS styles of a page, allowing for dynamic content changes and a more engaging user experience.</p>

            <img src="fe,be,fs.jpg" alt="mern">
            <p>HTML tags are keywords enclosed in angle brackets (<b>&lt; &gt;</b>) that define the structure and content of a web page. They instruct web browsers on how to render various elements, such as text, images, links, and other media. </p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="heading.html" target="_blank">Heading Tag</a></li>

            <hr>
                <h3> Table in HTML:</h3>
                <p>An HTML <a href="table.html" target="_blank"><b>table</b></a> is a structured way to display data in a grid-like format, using rows and columns. It is designed to present tabular data, such as schedules, financial reports, or any information that benefits from a clear, organized layout.</p>
                <h3>List in HTML:</h3>
                <p><b><a href="list.html">lists</a></b> should be used for structuring terms and their corresponding definitions, rather than an alternative table structure. Some information structures, particularly terms with corresponding definitions, can be marked up as either definition lists or tables.</p>

                <h3>Boiler Plate code of HTML</a></h3>
                <p>In HTML, <a href="tags.html" target="_blank">"<b>boilerplate code"</b></a> refers to the standard, foundational set of tags and declarations that are typically included at the beginning of every HTML document. This code provides the basic structure and essential information required for a web page to be correctly interpreted and displayed by a web browser.</p>
                <img src="struct.png" alt="Structure">
                <h3>File path System:</h3>
                <p>In HTML, you specify a file's location using a file path, which can be either <a href="absolute_relative.html" target="_blank"><b>absolute or relative</b></a>. Absolute paths are complete, while relative paths describe a location in relation to the current file. File paths are used to link to external resources such as images, stylesheets, and other HTML pages. </p>

                <h2>Selectors in HTML:</h2>
                <p><a href="div_id_class_span.html" target="_blank"><b>Selectors</b></a> in HTML, primarily used within the context of CSS, serve to "find" or select specific HTML elements to apply styles to them. These selectors allow for precise targeting of elements based on various criteria.</p>
                <img src="selector.png" alt="selector" width="400px">
                <h3>Types of Selectors:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Simple Selectors:</b></li>
                    <p>Target elements based on basic characteristics. </p>
                    <li><b>Element Selector:</b></li>
                    <p> Selects all instances of a specific HTML element (e.g., p for all paragraph elements). </p>
                    <li><b>ID Selector: </b></li>
                    <p>Selects a unique element based on its id attribute (e.g., #myID). An id should be unique within an HTML document. </p>
                    <li><b>Class Selector: </b></li>
                    <p>Selects elements based on their class attribute (e.g., .myClass). Multiple elements can share the same class. </p>
                    <li><b>Universal Selector: </b></li>
                    <p>Selects all elements on the page (e.g., *) </p>

            <hr>
                <h2>Forms in HTML:</h2>
            <p>An <a href="form.html" target="_blank"><b>HTML form</b></a> is a section within an HTML document used to collect user input. It is defined using the <b>&lt;form&gt;</b> tag and can contain various interactive controls, such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdown menus, and submit buttons.</p>
            <p>A form allows an organisation to collect a uniform set of data from many parties in a consistent manner. Forms, when completed, vary in their purpose; for example, a form might be a statement, a request, or an order. A cheque may also be considered a form. In addition, there are several forms for taxes.</p>
