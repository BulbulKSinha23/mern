    <h1>Lists in HTML</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>HTML offers three primary types of lists for structuring content:</p>
    <h2>Unordered Lists (&lt;ul&gt;):</h2>
    <p>These lists are used to group a set of related items where the order does not matter. Each list item is typically marked with a bullet point by default.</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Ordered Lists (&lt;ol&gt;):</h2> 
    <p>These lists are used to group a set of related items where the order is significant. Each list item is typically marked with numbers, letters, or Roman numerals by default, indicating a sequence.</p>

    <h3>The Target Attribute:</h3>
    <p>By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.</p>

    <p>The <b>target</b> attribute specifies where to open the linked document.</p>
    The <b>target</b> attribute can have one of the following values:
    <ul>
        <Li><b>_self</b>-  Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked</Li>  
        <li><b>_blank</b>- Opens the document in a new window or tab</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Nested List:</h2>
    <p>Nested lists in HTML allow for the creation of hierarchical structures by placing one list inside another. This is achieved by embedding a &lt;ul&gt; (unordered list) or &lt;ol&gt; (ordered list) element within an &lt;li&gt; (list item) element of a parent list. </p>
