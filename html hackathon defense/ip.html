    <h1>What is an IP Address?</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is a unique string of numbers assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves as an identifier that allows devices to send and receive data over the network, ensuring that this data reaches the correct destination.</p>
    <h2>Types of IP Address:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>IPV4</h3>
            <p>This is the most common form of IP Address. It consists of four sets of numbers separated by dots. For example, 192.158.1.38. Each set of numbers can range from 0 to 255. This format can support over 4 billion unique addresses. Here's how the structure is broken down:</p></li>

        <li><h3>IPV6</h3>
            <p>IPv6 addresses were created to deal with the shortage of IPv4 addresses. They use 128 bits instead of 32, offering a vastly greater number of possible addresses. These addresses are expressed as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, each group representing 16 bits. The groups are separated by colons.</p></li>
