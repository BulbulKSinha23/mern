    <h1>Mac Address</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>A MAC address (Media Access Control address) is a unique hardware identifier assigned to a Network Interface Card (NIC) in a device. It operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and is essential for local network communication. </p>
    <h2>Local Network Communication:</h2>
    <p>MAC addresses enable devices within the same local network (like your computer and a local server) to communicate and exchange data packets. This is fundamental for tasks such as testing local web applications or accessing resources on a local development server.</p>
    <h2>Device Identification:</h2>
    <p>While not directly used in most high-level web development tasks, the MAC address uniquely identifies your development machine on the local network, ensuring data is routed correctly.</p>
    <h2>Networking Fundamentals:</h2>
    <p>Understanding MAC addresses provides a foundational understanding of how networks function, which can be beneficial for troubleshooting network-related issues during web development, such as connectivity problems with a database server or API.</p>
