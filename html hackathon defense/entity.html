    <hr>
    <p> A "symbol entity" refers to a special sequence of characters used to represent a character that cannot be easily typed directly or might be interpreted as part of the HTML markup itself. These are also known as HTML character entities.</p>
    <h2>There are two primary ways to represent symbol entities:</h2>
    <b>Named Entities:</b> These use a name for the character, preceded by an ampersand (&) and followed by a semicolon (;).
